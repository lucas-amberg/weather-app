# Weather App
## About the project
This is a weather app I created over a few days to test my skills with the
Next.js framework.
## Current Features
* Search city by name
    * Currently only shows the first result the API finds
* View Current Temperature, Precipitation Chance, and Weather Type
* View High & Low Temperatures, Precipitation Chance, and Weather Type for the next 3 days
## Planned Features
* Search and view every city with weather data
* Switch weather type icons between night and day depending on the time at the location
