# Weather App
## About the project
This is a weather app I created over a few days to learn and test my ability with the Next.js framework, TypeScript language, and Tailwind CSS framework.
## Current Features
* Search and view every city with weather data
* View Current Temperature, Precipitation Chance, and Weather Type
* View High & Low Temperatures, Precipitation Chance, and Weather Type for the next 3 days
* Switch weather type icons between night and day depending on the time at the location
## Planned Features
* Switch between a light/dark mode
* Country flags for each location
